    Tracking Public Response and Relief Following the 2015 Nepal Earthquake (Accepted paper in CIC-DM 2016)

  This is one of my conclustions.

  <h2>
  This graph shows the international relief after the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. Each circle presents an actor, it could be government or organizations(If the actor appears with its country name, it is supposed to be the government). The larger the size is , the more aids they provided to Nepal
  I encoded countries as different colors. Then chose 10 active countries which provided more help to Nepal compared with other countries.
  </h2>

  <h2>
  Based on this graph, it is clear that there are only several organizations provided help to Nepal in some countries, like ISR and China. However, they provided aids more frequently. That's why the size of circle is large.
  On the other hand, plenty of organizations in USA helped Nepal.
